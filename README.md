# UselessBot Website

This project is a website dedicated to the UselessBot Discord bot, which I developed. It acts as a platform showcasing the bot's features, commands, and functionalities. The website offers guidance on how to invite the bot to a Discord server and provides detailed explanations for various commands, including their usage descriptions.
